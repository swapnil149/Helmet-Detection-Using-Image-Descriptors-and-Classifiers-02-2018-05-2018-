Motorcycle accidents have been rapidly growing throughout the years in many countries. So, to protect the head of bike rider during accidents, helmets are suggested. The main aim of this dissertation is to propose an approach for detection of bike-riders without
helmet. For this, First detection of bike riders from surveillance video using background subtraction and object segmentation is done. Then determined whether bike-rider is using a helmet or not using visual features and binary classifier. In order to evaluate the approach, a performance comparison of three widely used kernels in SVM classifier namely linear, sigmoid (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) for classification is provided. Indeed, the algorithm step regarding the helmet detection accomplished an accuracy rate of 96.67%.
